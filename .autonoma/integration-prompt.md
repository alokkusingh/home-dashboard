<!-- Autonoma integration prompt v9 -->
You are integrating Autonoma into THIS application, working in a LOCAL checkout of
the repo. The Autonoma planner has ALREADY run locally and produced its artifacts
(knowledge base, entity audit, scenarios) at:
    /Users/aloksingh/.autonoma/home-dashboard
You are the developer picking up exactly where the planner hands off: implement the
test-data layer (the SDK integration), GENERATE the test-data recipe, and validate
it. Do NOT re-run the planner; read its artifacts as your spec.

Work without asking questions. Make reasonable, codebase-grounded decisions. Only
stop for missing secrets, credentials, or external services that genuinely cannot
be mocked or run locally - and when you do, say exactly what you need and why.

═══ BRANCH FIRST - BEFORE YOU CHANGE A SINGLE FILE ═══
Your work ships to the developer as a pull request, so cut the branch before your
first edit - never commit onto the default branch. Do not assume it is called "main":
read it from the remote (`git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`, or
`git remote show origin`), then:
    git fetch origin
    git switch --create autonoma-integration origin/<default-branch>
Two cases to handle before you run that:
  • The working tree already has uncommitted changes: they are the developer's, so do
    NOT stash, discard, or commit them. Branch off the CURRENT HEAD instead, and keep
    them out of your commit later.
  • A branch from a prior session already exists (or you are already on one): stay on
    it and continue there rather than cutting a second one.
If this checkout is not a git repository at all, skip the branch and say so at the end -
everything else in this prompt still applies.

═══ DISCOVER FIRST (never assume) ═══
Before writing anything, investigate this specific app with your tools. Determine,
from the actual source, every one of:
  • language, package manager, and how to install/build/typecheck/lint/test
  • backend framework and how routes/handlers are declared
  • the auth system (sessions, JWT, cookies, a third-party provider) and how a
    request is authenticated end to end
  • the data layer (ORM/query builder/raw SQL), the models, and the REAL creation
    path for each model (services, repositories, invariants, required relations,
    enum values, defaults, side effects)
  • how the app is started and served locally, AND how to connect to its database
    to inspect rows (you will query the DB directly to verify each factory)
Do not pattern-match on file names or directory layouts. Read the code. The right
conventions are whatever THIS repo already uses - mirror them.

═══ GET THE APP RUNNING LOCALLY ═══
You need the app running to validate your integration. Bring it up locally the way
the repo documents: install dependencies, start whatever backing services it needs
(a database, a gateway, etc.), and start the server. Read the repo's own
README/scripts to learn how - do not assume. Note the URL your SDK endpoint answers
on; you pass it to the validation commands below.

═══ PREREQUISITES - STOP IF MISSING ═══
Autonoma generates END-TO-END tests that drive a real USER INTERFACE backed by its
APIs. This only works when BOTH a frontend/UI to exercise AND every backend service
that UI depends on are present and runnable. Before any integration work, confirm
both are here. If the UI is absent, or a backend the UI needs cannot be run locally,
STOP immediately and say EXACTLY what is missing and why you can't proceed.

═══ OBJECTIVE ═══
0. Read the planner's artifacts (knowledge base, entity audit, scenarios) in the
   output directory above. They are your spec for what entities and scenarios must
   exist. The planner is done; do not re-run it, and do NOT delete or modify anything
   already in that directory - you only ADD your recipe.json and the completion marker.
1. Install the Autonoma SDK and the backend adapter for THIS repo's language. The SDK
   is published for many languages under different package names and registries (npm,
   PyPI, Go modules, RubyGems, ...), so DISCOVER the correct package + adapter for this
   stack from the SDK docs (https://docs.autonoma.app/sdk) - do NOT assume the
   JavaScript/npm package.
2. Implement ONE endpoint (prefer "/api/autonoma" unless the repo has a
   clearly better convention) that handles the discover / up / down protocol through
   the SDK handler. The signing secret AUTONOMA_SHARED_SECRET is ALREADY provisioned
   in the app's environment - verify the x-signature HMAC against that env value (the
   SDK reads it for you). Do NOT hardcode a secret or overwrite the env value.
3. Implement a real factory for EVERY entity the entity audit says needs one:
   • CREATE THROUGH THE APP'S OWN CODE, NOT RAW DB WRITES. The entity audit names a
     creation_function (and its side_effects) for each entity - call THAT function
     (inject or instantiate the service the app itself uses) so its real business
     logic and side effects actually run. A raw insert silently skips validation,
     hashing, derived fields, relation/permission wiring - exactly what this
     integration exists to avoid. The audit has no line numbers, so VERIFY each named
     creation_function actually exists in its creation_file; if the entry is stale,
     DISCOVER the real creation path yourself before wiring the factory. Fall back to
     a raw write ONLY when the real creation function genuinely cannot run locally.
     Even then, TRY it first and fall back only on an ACTUAL failure. When you fall
     back, say so for that entity and note which side_effects you reproduced by hand.
   • Some models have NO reusable creation function - the app writes them with an
     inline data-layer insert inside a request handler. For these, COPY that insert
     into your factory (open the named creation_file, replicate the exact insert, and
     DROP the handler's request/auth/external-service side effects), then give it a
     scoped-delete teardown. NEVER satisfy such a factory by calling the handler over
     HTTP. (Trace one level in first: if the handler delegates to a reusable function,
     call that instead; only copy the insert when the write is genuinely inlined.)
   • preserve invariants, relations, enums, defaults, and side effects
   • support recipe references (an _alias to name a created row, an _ref to point at
     another alias); create parents before children
   • return created refs in the shape the SDK expects
4. Implement teardown. PREFER deleting by the scoping root: if the app scopes data by
   a tenant (an organization / workspace / account - most do), tear down by deleting
   that scope and letting cascades remove everything under it. This is simpler AND it
   also removes rows a test created that were never in "up" (e.g. an invoice created
   mid-test), which per-record teardown would leak. Only when there is no such scope,
   fall back to deleting each created record in reverse dependency order. Either way,
   be idempotent where practical, and NEVER delete non-test data - scope strictly by
   the seeded tenant / the test run / a unique marker.
5. Implement the auth callback so the test runner gets REAL, usable credentials for
   the seeded user (valid cookies / a valid Authorization header / real login
   credentials) - never a placeholder token.
6. Leave a maintenance note so the integration stays in sync as the schema evolves.
   Find the repo's agent-instructions file (AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md; check the app
   directory and repo root, or create AGENTS.md at the repo root). Append a short
   "Autonoma test data" section that (a) explains in 2-3 sentences what Autonoma is
   and that it seeds realistic test data through this endpoint's factories via the
   app's own creation paths, and (b) instructs the reader to add/update the matching
   factory whenever they add or change models or the code that creates them. Keep it
   brief and match the file's tone; don't duplicate an equivalent existing note.

═══ YOU GENERATE THE RECIPE ═══
There is no pre-written recipe. YOU build it at:
    /Users/aloksingh/.autonoma/home-dashboard/recipe.json
It is a JSON file of the form:
    {
      "version": 1,
      "source": { "discoverPath": "discover.json", "scenariosPath": "scenarios.md" },
      "validationMode": "endpoint-lifecycle",
      "recipes": [
        { "name": "standard", "description": "<short>",
          "create": { "<EntityName>": [ { "_alias": "x_1", ...fields }, ... ] },
          "validation": { "status": "validated", "method": "endpoint-up-down" } }
      ]
    }
The "create" object maps each entity name to an array of records. Records use _alias
(to name a created row) and _ref (to point at a parent's alias). Populate it from
scenarios.md so the data realizes those scenarios. Build it up entity by entity as
you go (see the loop below) and keep the envelope intact.

Every value in "create" must be CONCRETE - a real email, name, or id - with exactly two
exceptions. Autonoma substitutes these built-in tokens per run, because concurrent runs
of the same scenario would otherwise collide on unique columns:
  • {{testRunId}}      - this run's id, the same value your endpoint receives as "testRunId"
  • {{testRunShortId}} - an 8-character hash of it, for columns too short to hold a UUID
Put one inside any field that must be unique per run, as part of a longer string so the
value still reads as real: "admin+{{testRunId}}@acme.test", "acme-{{testRunShortId}}".
Any OTHER {{token}} is rejected on upload: there is no general variable mechanism, so
never invent one.

WHICH fields need a token is not a judgement call and not a guess from the field name.
Before you write the recipe, ENUMERATE the uniqueness rules for every entity you seed:
read the schema definitions and migrations, and query the live database you are already
connected to for its unique constraints and unique indexes. Then put a token inside a
value covered by each one (for a composite unique tuple, tokenizing a single member is
enough). Non-obvious constraints - an external reference, a code, a composite
(tenant, name) - are exactly the ones name-matching misses. A unique column with no
token is the one defect single-instance testing cannot reveal: it surfaces only when a
customer runs two tests at once.

═══ TRACK YOUR WORK - DO NOT STOP UNTIL IT IS COMPLETE ═══
Before implementing, write a checklist file inside the app (e.g. IMPLEMENTATION.md)
and keep it updated. It must enumerate, as explicit checkboxes: EVERY entity the
entity audit says needs a factory (by name, copied from the audit), plus the
endpoint, teardown, the auth callback, the maintenance note, the full-recipe pass,
the two-concurrent-instances proof, and the pushed branch + opened pull request.
Check items off only when actually done and verified. The single most common failure is stopping with entities left uncovered.

═══ VALIDATE - ENTITY BY ENTITY, THEN THE WHOLE RECIPE ═══
You validate your own work by driving the endpoint through THIS CLI's signed client
and inspecting the database. The CLI signs every request with the canonical secret
from the environment, so you never construct signatures yourself. The commands:
  • /usr/local/bin/node /Users/aloksingh/.npm/_npx/7a17110e47753839/node_modules/.bin/autonoma-planner sdk discover --url <endpoint-url>
  • /usr/local/bin/node /Users/aloksingh/.npm/_npx/7a17110e47753839/node_modules/.bin/autonoma-planner sdk up --url <endpoint-url> --recipe <file> [--test-run-id <id>] [--timeout <seconds>]
        (prints JSON; the response body includes a "refsToken")
  • /usr/local/bin/node /Users/aloksingh/.npm/_npx/7a17110e47753839/node_modules/.bin/autonoma-planner sdk down --url <endpoint-url> --refs-token <token-from-up>
The --recipe file may be your full recipe.json or a slice containing just the
entities under test. Each request times out after 120s by default; a cold
full-recipe up (first compile + many real-service inserts) can exceed that, so
pass --timeout <seconds> to raise it rather than falling back to smaller slices.

`sdk up` resolves {{testRunId}} and {{testRunShortId}} before sending, exactly as the
platform does, and prints the "testRunId" and "resolvedVariables" it used next to the
response. So the database holds the SUBSTITUTED values, never the literal token - read
"resolvedVariables" to know what to query for. A substituted value in the DB is the
token WORKING; never "fix" that by replacing the token with a hardcoded value.

Work through the entities in dependency order (parents before children). For EACH
entity:
  1. Implement or fix that entity's factory.
  2. Add/fix that entity's records in the recipe (with its required parents present -
     the single-entity dependency chain; an Order needs its Customer).
  3. Write a slice file with just this entity (and its parents) and run:
        /usr/local/bin/node /Users/aloksingh/.npm/_npx/7a17110e47753839/node_modules/.bin/autonoma-planner sdk up --url <url> --recipe <slice>
  4. Query the DATABASE directly and confirm the expected rows were created (right
     table, right values, relations wired) - not just that up returned 200.
  5. Run: /usr/local/bin/node /Users/aloksingh/.npm/_npx/7a17110e47753839/node_modules/.bin/autonoma-planner sdk down --url <url> --refs-token <token-from-up>
  6. Query the DATABASE again and confirm those rows are GONE.
  7. If any check failed, fix the right thing - the FACTORY CODE or the RECIPE DATA,
     whichever the failure points to - and repeat from step 3. Loop until green.

Once every entity passes independently, run the FULL recipe as one pass:
  • /usr/local/bin/node /Users/aloksingh/.npm/_npx/7a17110e47753839/node_modules/.bin/autonoma-planner sdk up --url <url> --recipe /Users/aloksingh/.autonoma/home-dashboard/recipe.json  -> succeeds
  • confirm all rows created (DB), then down with the refsToken -> succeeds, rows gone (DB)
  • confirm a WRONG signature is rejected (the SDK does this for you - do not disable it)
  • confirm the up response's auth payload contains real credentials, not a placeholder

═══ PROVE TWO INSTANCES CAN COEXIST - MANDATORY, LAST ═══
Every check above tears down before the next up, so a recipe whose unique columns hold
hardcoded values passes all of them. Real test runs OVERLAP: the customer runs two tests
at once and the second seed hits the first one's rows. Prove yours survives that:
  1. /usr/local/bin/node /Users/aloksingh/.npm/_npx/7a17110e47753839/node_modules/.bin/autonoma-planner sdk up --url <url> --recipe /Users/aloksingh/.autonoma/home-dashboard/recipe.json --test-run-id concurrent-a
  2. /usr/local/bin/node /Users/aloksingh/.npm/_npx/7a17110e47753839/node_modules/.bin/autonoma-planner sdk up --url <url> --recipe /Users/aloksingh/.autonoma/home-dashboard/recipe.json --test-run-id concurrent-b
     (do NOT tear down A first - both instances must be up at the same time)
  3. BOTH must succeed. Then down A, then down B, and confirm in the DB that each
     teardown removed only its own rows and that nothing is left behind.
A failure here is a unique-constraint violation, and it names the exact column that is
not per-run. Fix it where it lives: put a token in that field if the recipe supplies it,
or derive it from the "testRunId" your handler receives if your factory generates it.
Then repeat from step 1. Do not weaken the constraint and do not disable the check.

Escape hatch, only after honest attempts: if an entity truly cannot be seeded twice
concurrently because the app's own schema forces a global singleton, write that in
IMPLEMENTATION.md - name the table, the constraint, and why it cannot be made per-run -
and then proceed. Never leave this step silently unfinished.

═══ SHIP IT - COMMIT, PUSH, OPEN A PULL REQUEST ═══
Everything green means nothing until the developer can review it. Once the full recipe
and the concurrency proof pass, put the work up as a pull request - do not leave it
sitting uncommitted in the working tree:
  1. Read `git status` and `git diff` and stage ONLY your integration: the endpoint,
     the factories, the SDK dependency and its lockfile change, and the maintenance
     note. Leave the developer's pre-existing uncommitted changes out of it, and NEVER
     commit secrets, .env files, credentials, or local scratch output.
  2. Commit in the style the repo already uses (read `git log`) - one commit is fine.
  3. Push the branch and set its upstream:
        git push --set-upstream origin autonoma-integration
  4. Open a pull request against the DEFAULT branch you cut from, using the repo's own
     tooling if it is installed and authenticated (e.g. `gh pr create --base <default>`).
     Describe what you added: the endpoint path, which entities got factories, how
     teardown is scoped, and anything you documented as a limitation. If no PR tool is
     available or authenticated, the push is still mandatory - then print the compare
     URL the push prints back so the developer can open the PR in one click.
  5. If pushing or opening the PR genuinely cannot be done (no remote, no write access,
     no auth, not a git repo), leave the work COMMITTED on the branch and write which
     step failed and why in IMPLEMENTATION.md. Committing is the one part you can always
     do - never stop at an uncommitted working tree.

═══ FINISH - THE LAST THING YOU DO ═══
Write the completion marker once ALL of these hold:
  • every entity, the full-recipe pass, and the two-concurrent-instances proof are green
    - or the blocking constraint is documented in IMPLEMENTATION.md
  • /Users/aloksingh/.autonoma/home-dashboard/recipe.json holds the recipe you validated
  • your work is committed, and pushed with a pull request open - or the reason you could
    not push / open one is documented in IMPLEMENTATION.md
A step you documented as genuinely blocked NEVER justifies withholding the marker; a
checklist item you simply have not finished always does. The marker is how the CLI knows
the session is done and can upload the recipe:
    /Users/aloksingh/.autonoma/home-dashboard/.sdk-integration-complete
Its contents MUST be exactly:
    { "complete": true }
Writing it is not optional: the planner watches for this marker and takes the terminal
back shortly after it appears. After writing it, end with ONE short closing message that
names the pull request you opened - or, if you couldn't open one, the branch you pushed,
or the commit you left behind and what blocked the push - and then says:
    "The integration is done. The Autonoma planner takes this terminal back in a
    few seconds to continue the setup - or exit now to continue immediately."
Nothing after that message - no further questions, summaries, or work.
